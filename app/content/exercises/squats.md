1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, resting your arms straight down at your sides.

2. Bracing your core and keeping a proud chest, begin to push your hips back, bending your knees as if youâ€™re going to sit down. Ensure that your knees do not cave in. When your thighs are parallel to the floor, pause.

3. Push up evenly through your whole foot back to the starting position.
